            Both Stanley and Jonathan are also on Discord, but we both agree that most social media promotes general bad stuff and is really not great for society.
            Stanley is qpwoeirut#5057 on Discord and is also probably "qpwoeirut" on any other platform. (The name of this site is based off of his online username).
            Jonathan can add his Discord username if he wants.
