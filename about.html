                    qpwoeirut.com was created by <a href="https://github.com/JonathanUhler">Jonathan Uhler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut">Stanley</a>. 
                    We are two high school students who are interested in computer science and programming.
                    The idea for this website came up during the COVID-19 pandemic, since we needed something to do during lockdown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to look into JavaScript and HTML and began to work on an arcade-themed website.
                    Our site offers a selection of simple games to play whenever you want.
                    The site is also static, so you can download the games to play offline by cloning the repository on GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our work is written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. 
                    The project repository can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut/GamesAndGadgets">here</a>.

                    We met as students in Bowman School and have kept in touch after graduation.

                    Stanley spends a lot of time doing competitve programming, including the USA Computing Olympiad and CodeForces.
                    At time of writing, he has a rating of 2107 of <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/qpwoeirut">CodeForces</a>.
                    <br>
                    He's also part of the <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/118163">RGBsec</a> CTF team, and specializes in cryptography.

                    Jonathan works on miscellaneous projects in a number of different languages, as well as some computer science contests on CodeForces and other sites.
                    Most of Jonathan's work can be found on GitHub.

                    Since this entire website is static, it can be downloaded and everything should still work.
                    To download the website you can go to our repository on <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut/GamesAndGadgets">GitHub</a> and clone it.
                    Then to play just open up the website file in your web browser.
