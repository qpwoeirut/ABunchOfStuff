                    <p>qpwoeirut.com was created by <a href="https://github.com/JonathanUhler">Jonathan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut">Stanley</a>. 
                        We are two high school students who are interested in computer science and programming.
                        The idea for this website started after we finished our previous work with COBOL, an old programming language used for business, finance, and administrative systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided to look into JavaScrip and HTML and began work on an arcade-themed website.
                        Our site offers a selection of simple games to play whenever you want.
                        We currently have a roster of 6 games: Atari Breakout, Conway's Game of Life, Hangman, Minesweeper, Pong, and Snake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of our work is written in JavaScrip, HTML, and CSS using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. 
                        The project repository can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut/GamesAndGadgets">here</a>.
