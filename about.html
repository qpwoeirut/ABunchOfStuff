                    qpwoeirut.com was created by <a href="https://github.com/JonathanUhler">Jonathan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut">Stanley</a>. 
                    We are two high school students who are interested in computer science and programming.
                    The idea for this website came up during the COVID-19 pandemic, since we needed something to do during lockdown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to look into JavaScript and HTML and began to work on an arcade-themed website.
                    Our site offers a selection of simple games to play whenever you want.
                    We currently have a roster of 6 games: Atari Breakout, Conway's Game of Life, Hangman, Minesweeper, Pong, and Snake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our work is written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. 
                    The project repository can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/qpwoeirut/GamesAndGadgets">here</a>.

                        Stanley also spends a lot of time doing competitve programming, including the USA Computing Olympiad and CodeForces.
                        At time of writing, he has a rating of 2107 of CodeForces (flex). His account is <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/qpwoeirut">here</a>.

                        Jonathan also works on miscellaneous projects in a number of different languages, as well as some computer science contests on CodeForces and other sites.
                        Most of Jonathan's work can be found on GitHub.
